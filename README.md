# Web-Automation
ðŸ§  Automates job searches from MyJobMag using Selenium â€” kills popups, clicks listings, grabs job data, and exports it all to Excel.
Selenium-based Python script that scrapes Data Analyst job listings from MyJobMag Kenya and exports them to an Excel file â€” organized, timestamped, and ready for action.
It navigates popups, triggers job searches, extracts key info from job descriptions, and refreshes the page when things get a little too dramatic (looking at you, random logout bugs).
